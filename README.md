# UF2
UF2 update file archive for the Pathfinder BMS.

UF2 update files are organized in folders by version. Each folder includes a readme with the changelog and the UF2 update file.

ALPHA builds are not recommended for customers to use unless you want to test a specific experimental feature.     

To update a Pathfinder BMS, connect it to a computer via the USB-C port.     
Put the BMS in UF2 mode by navigating to UF2 mode via the OLED user interface.     
Alternative method: hold the BACK button while resetting or powering on the BMS.

A new USB storage device should become known to the computer with the name "OKS_BMS_UF2"

Drag and drop or copy the UF2 file into this storage device. When the file transfer is finished the BMS will reboot and execute the new firmware.
